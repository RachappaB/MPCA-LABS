Solve A2.1 and A2.2 given in the Course information

Solve the below problems:


Consider the following sequence of instructions in MIPS architecture.
LDR  R1, [R2,#40]
ADD R2, R3, R3
ADD R1, R1, R2
STR R1, [R2,#20]
a.  Find all dependencies in this instruction sequence.
b.  Find all hazards in this instruction sequence for a five stage pipeline with and without data forwarding.
c.  Find whether NOPs are required to be introduced inspite of data   forwarding in this instruction sequence


.Consider the following sequence of instructions in MIPS architecture.
               LDR  R1, [R6,#40]
               BEQ  R2, R3, LABEL2   ; BRANCH TAKEN
               ADD R1, R6, R4
LABEL2:BEQ R1,R2, LABEL1      ; BRANCH NOT TAKEN
               STR R2,[R4, #20]
               AND R1, R1, R4
 
a.   Draw the pipeline execution diagram for this code, assuming there are
  no delay slots and that branches execute in the EX stage.b.   Repeat the exercise mentioned in a and draw the 
  pipeline execution diagram for this code, assuming that delay slots are used by writing a “SAFE INSTRUCTION” in the delay slot.
